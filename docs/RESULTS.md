### Dataset / Graph Representation ###
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vineethakkinapalli/citibike-bike-sharingnewyork-cityjan-to-apr-2021) provides us data formatted as follows (taken from the dataset documentation):
```
tripduration - Duration in Seconds
starttime - Start Time and Date
stoptime - Stop Time and Date
start station id - ID of Start Station
start station name - Name of Start Station
start station latitude - Latitude of start station
start station longitude - Longitude of start station
end station id - ID of End Station
end station name - Name of End Station
end station latitude - Latitude of End station
end station longitude - Longitude of End station
Bike ID - Bike ID
usertype - Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member
gender - Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female
birthyear - Year of Birth
```
#### Files: data folder
We generate a graph with verticies as the dataset stations, and 1 edge is drawn between 2 nodes if there has been at least 1 trip between the stations that they represent. The graph edges are weighted based on the distance between the stations calculated using the latitude and longitude values.

The dataset files are concatenated into 1 large file. We account for human error in the data provided (clean the data) by checking that all lines of data used in the creation of the graph have viable start station id, start station name, start station latitude, start station longitude, end station id, end station name, end station latitude, end station longitude data fields. Otherwise, that line of data is not used.

  <b> Runtime: </b> O(max(|E|, |V|))
 
## Using Dijkstra's Algorithm to Find the Shortest Bike Path That Traverses Every Bike Station in New York City ##
#### Files: Graph.h, Graph.cpp
  <b> Inputs: </b> 
   * A pointer to the vertex to find the minimum spanning tree from
 
  <b> Output: </b> 
   * A pair containing:
      * The graph that represents the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph representing the bike paths in New York City from the given vertex (first)
      * A map with:  
        * Key: int representing the station id of the vertex to find the previous vertex of
        * Value: Previous vertex of the given vertex in the shortest path produced by running Dijkstra's on the graph

 
  <b> Result: </b>

  Degrees Latitude of the Directed Acyclic Graph Produced by Dijkstra's on the Full Dataset : 91.5746

  Shortest Station Path Across NYC:

  <b> Runtime: </b> O(|E| + |V|log(|V|))
 
## Determining if there is an Euler Circuit or Euler Path ##
#### Files: Graph.h, Graph.cpp
 
  <b> Inputs: </b> The graph generated by the dataset (as described in the Dataset/ Graph Representation section)
 
 
  <b> Outputs: </b>
 
  <i>Whether an Euler Circuit can exist: </i> 
   * 0 if not Eulerian
   * 1 if there is a Euler Path
   * 2 if there is a Euler Circuit
 
  <b> Result </b>: 
  ```
  Graph is Eulerian: 0 (Not Eulerian)
  Graph is Connected: 1 (Graph is Connected)
  ```
  <b> Runtime: </b> O(|V|)
 
 
## Finding the Largest Hamiltonian Cycle ##
#### Files: Graph.h, Graph.cpp
  <b> Inputs: </b> The graph generated by the dataset (as described in the Dataset/ Graph Representation section)
 
 
  <b> Output: </b> A graph that represents the largest hamiltonian cycle in the graph representing all bike paths
  in New York City
  
  <b> Result </b>: Due the large amount of data and the fact that this algorithm in NP-Complete, it would take an extremely long time to run the code on the full dataset and thus we do not know if there is a hamiltonian cycle in the across all bike stations in NYC.

  <b> Runtime: </b> O((2|E|)!)

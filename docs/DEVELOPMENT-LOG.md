# Development Log
### 10/17/21
**What We Planned**
- Meet the team for the first time!
- Write and sign contract
- Setup workflow
- Discuss project ideas

**What We Acomplished**
- Meet the team for the first time!
- Write and sign contract
- Setup workflow
- Discuss project ideas

**Goals for Next Week**
- Bring (1-2) proposed datasets to ideate around
- Figure out what algorithms we want to do and runtime for each
- Finalize leading question, dataset and start thinking about timeline

### 10/25/21
**What We Planned**
- Bring (1-2) proposed datasets to ideate around
- Figure out what algorithms we want to do and runtime for each
- Finalize leading question, dataset and start thinking about timeline

**What We Acomplished**
- Presented our datasets
- Emailed the professor to check on the list of covered algorithms in class
- Vote asynchonously for the dataset we want to focus on
- We decided to use the NYC Squrriel Census, but then scrapped.
- We hope to focus on the emoji dataset and have the covid dataset as backup.
- Unicode character name relation to emoji, research on what the pattern is is needed.

**This Week Follow up**
- Decide if emoji dataset is viable (if pattern is found) -> Megan by tmr morning
- Decide on the algorithms -> Everyone by thurs, discuss on discord asynch

**Goals for Next Week**
- Create a timeline for the rest of our project
- Assign our first coding task

# Analyzing Biking Paths Across New York City
CS 225 Final Project -  drshika2-meghanr6-jyt3-joannah2
 
## Overview ##
<i> After loading in the data from the dataset (described below), we use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest bike path to traverse all bike stations in New York City. Using a DFS traversal, we determined there is not a Euler Circuit or Euler Path in the graph representing the New York City bike paths. Discovering this, we then attempted to find the largest hamiltonian cycle created by the New York City bike paths; however, due the large amount of data and the fact that this algorithm in NP-Complete,
it would take an extremely long time to run the code and we do not know if there is a hamiltonian cycle in the dataset. We also learned
that the graph is connected </i>
 
### Dataset / Graph Representation ###
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vineethakkinapalli/citibike-bike-sharingnewyork-cityjan-to-apr-2021) provides us data formatted as follows (taken from the dataset documentation):
```
tripduration - Duration in Seconds
starttime - Start Time and Date
stoptime - Stop Time and Date
start station id - ID of Start Station
start station name - Name of Start Station
start station latitude - Latitude of start station
start station longitude - Longitude of start station
end station id - ID of End Station
end station name - Name of End Station
end station latitude - Latitude of End station
end station longitude - Longitude of End station
Bike ID - Bike ID
usertype - Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member
gender - Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female
birthyear - Year of Birth
```
#### Files: data folder
We generate a graph with verticies as the dataset stations, and 1 edge is drawn between 2 nodes if there has been at least 1 trip between the stations that they represent. The graph edges are weighted based on the distance between the stations calculated using the latitude and longitude values.

The dataset files are concatenated into 1 large file. We account for human error in the data provided (clean the data) by checking that all lines of data used in the creation of the graph have viable start station id, start station name, start station latitude, start station longitude, end station id, end station name, end station latitude, end station longitude data fields. Otherwise, that line of data is not used.
 
## Depth First Search Graph Traversal #

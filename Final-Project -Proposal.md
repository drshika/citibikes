# Analyzing Biking Paths Across New York City
CS 225 Final Project Proposal for drshika2-meghanr6-jyt3-joannah2

<i>This goal of this project is to analyze the biking paths across New York City. First, we will try to find the shortest bike path across New York City using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Next, we will determine whether or not there is an Euler Circut or Euler Path in the graph representing the New York City bike paths. Depending on our answer to this question, we will: (a) Find an Euler Circut in the graph, (b) Find an Euler Path in the graph, or (c) Find the largest hamiltonian cycle created by the New York City bike paths </i>

## Dataset / Graph Representation ##
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vineethakkinapalli/citibike-bike-sharingnewyork-cityjan-to-apr-2021) provides us data formatted as follows (taken from the dataset documentation): 
``` 
tripduration - Duration in Seconds
starttime - Start Time and Date
stoptime - Stop Time and Date
start station id - ID of Start Station
start station name - Name of Start Station
start station latitude - Latitude of start station
start station longitude - Longitude of start station
end station id - ID of End Station
end station name - Name of End Station
end station latitude - Latitude of End station
end station longitude - Longitude of End station
Bike ID - Bike ID
usertype - Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member
gender - Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female
birthyear - Year of Birth 
```
We plan to generate a graph with nodes as the stations from this dataset. Edges will be drawn between nodes if there has been at least 1 trip between the stations that they represent.


First, we will concatenate all of the files into the dataset into 1 large file. Then, we plan to account for human error in the data provided (clean the data) by checking that all lines of data used in the creation of the graph have viable start station id, start station name, start station latitude, start station longitude, end station id, end station name, end station latitude, end station longitude data fields. Otherwise, we will not use that line of data.
Additionally, we will be careful as to not draw multiple edges between nodes when reading in trips between two stations that we have already drawn an edge between

## Using Dijkstra's Algorithm to Find the Shortest Bike Path Across New York City ##
  <b> Inputs: </b> We will choose the nodes to run Dijkstra's Algorithm on by using the latitude and longitudes of the bike stations to find the Northwest-most station and the Southeast-most station within the bounds of New York City.
  
  
  <b> Output: </b> A list of stations to travel between in an order that reflects the shortest bike path across New York City
  
  
  <b> Target Runtime: </b> O(|E| + |V|log(|V|))

## Determining if there is an Euler Circut or Euler Path ##
  <b> Inputs: </b> The graph generated by the dataset (as described in the Dataset/ Graph Representation section)
  
  
  <b> Outputs: </b>
  
  <i>Whether an Euler Circut can exist: </i> True if there are no nodes with odd degrees
  
  
  <i>Whether an Euler Path can exist: </i> True if there are 0 or 2 nodes with odd degrees
  
  <b> Target Runtime: </b> O(|V|)


## Hierholzer's Algorithm ##

  <b> Inputs: </b> The graph generated by the dataset (as described in the Dataset/ Graph Representation section)
  
  
  <b> Output: </b> A list of stations to travel between in an order that reflects the Euler Path/Circut in the graph
  
  
  <b> Target Runtime: </b> O(|E|)

## Finding the Largest Hamiltonian Cycle ##
  <b> Inputs: </b> The graph generated by the dataset (as described in the Dataset/ Graph Representation section)
  
  
  <b> Output: </b> A list of stations to travel between in an order that reflects the largest Hamiltonian Cycle in the Graph
  
  
  <b> Target Runtime: </b> O(|V|^2(2^|V|))

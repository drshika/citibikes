# CS 225 Data Structures
## Team Contract (drshika2-meghanr6-jyt3-joannah2)
### Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Sunday from 5:30-6:30pm using Discord (optionally in person at the CIF). 
Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with meghanr6. Notes will
be stored on this Github Repository on the 'meeting-notes.md' file as commits every week. The note-taker is also
responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry ('DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md'), which is approved by the
team at the start of the following week’s meeting.
2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through Discord, cell, email (in order of preference). Outside
of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.
3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly
meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak
or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project.
All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred,
it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering
to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.
### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined
by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. These can be acessed on the project board for this github repository.
Each team member will be assigned 1-2 issues per week and they will be reponsible for submitting a Pull Request prior to the group meeting. When
no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a
paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments
can be made on a case by case basis.
2. **Workflow** Each team member will work on their assigned issue(s) every week. When they complete the issue, they will submit a pull request with their changes.
If these changes are approved by at least two group members, they can merge to Master. 
Each team member will be expected to work on the branch with the name of their netid. 
3. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to
independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project.
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist
with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or
programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to
make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked –
politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such
as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team
members.
4. **Conflict Resolution** All conflicts within the team will be decided by a Super Smash Bros
match, Final Destination, 3 stock no items. The winner will decide who was right and who
was wrong (Might makes right).
